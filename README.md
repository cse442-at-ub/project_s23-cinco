# Team Cinco's Project
This project is a social media website that's meant to help people find events that are occuring in their area. This helps individuals if they want to do stuff with their friends or family, and can help organizations advertise whatever events they are hosting.

## Project structure
The only folder that is really altered on a consistent basis is the src folder. Within the src folder are subfolders:

* Components- javascript code for the composition of webpages. There are also folders within this folder that help divide up different webpages like the feed, profile page, etc.

* Images- where all the pictures for things we would use for the website, like the logo, will go.

* Style- where all the css files for stylizing the web pages will go

App.js and index.js is like any other project that is made with the npx create-react-app npm command
